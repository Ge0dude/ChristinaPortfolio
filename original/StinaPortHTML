<H3 class="blue"> Welcome! </H2>

<P class="bodyofh2"> As always, I decided to learn something new and I want to show and tell everyone. Coding 
 and designing are just a few of the many subjects that I am currently exploring and eagerly
 excited to share with my friends and family. Soon (I <span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> hope</span> know) I will use this website as more 
 than just a quirky way of expressing myself but also as a professional webpage that displays my    
 achievements and goals.
